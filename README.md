Comedic Artifact made with Claude. 

Tool for American expats that will "translate" their painfully direct emails or texts into language better understood by their perfectly pleasent British colleagues. 

User can adjust for desired level of British-ness: 
Level 0-1: Minimal changes, just basic politeness
Level 2: More "please/thank you", gentle language  
Level 3: British understatement, self-deprecation, weather references
Level 4: Full British stereotype mode - MUST include a pub reference, mention of Guinness, and "God save the King" naturally worked into the email
